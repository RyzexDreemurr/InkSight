# 📚 InkSight - Comprehensive Project Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

**InkSight** is a ReadEra-inspired ebook reader built with Expo/React Native, designed to provide a clean, functional, and distraction-free reading experience. The app prioritizes reading optimization over flashy design, supporting multiple formats (EPUB, PDF, TXT, MOBI) with comprehensive library management and advanced reading features.

### **Core Philosophy**
- **Function over form**: Clean, efficient interface focused on reading experience
- **Offline-first**: Complete functionality without internet dependency
- **Privacy-focused**: No data sharing, local storage only
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent experience on iOS and Android

## 🎨 UI Design Strategy

### **Hybrid Design Approach**

We're implementing a strategic hybrid approach that combines the best of both worlds:

#### **Material Design 3 Screens (70% of app)**
- **Library Management**: Book grid/list views, search, filters, categories
- **Settings & Configuration**: Reading preferences, themes, app settings
- **Utility Screens**: Book details, file browser, import screens
- **Navigation**: Bottom tabs, stack navigation, modal screens

**Benefits**: Fast development, familiar patterns, built-in accessibility, cross-platform consistency

#### **Custom Reading Interface (30% of app)**
- **Reading View**: Minimalist, distraction-free book display
- **Reading Controls**: Custom gestures, page navigation, progress indicators
- **Theme System**: Reading-optimized color schemes and typography
- **Annotation Interface**: Highlights, bookmarks, notes

**Benefits**: Optimized reading experience, zero distractions, reading-specific interactions

### **Design Principles**
1. **Clarity**: Clear information hierarchy and intuitive navigation
2. **Focus**: Minimal distractions during reading sessions
3. **Consistency**: Predictable interactions across all screens
4. **Accessibility**: Support for all users including those with disabilities
5. **Performance**: Smooth animations and responsive interactions

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **State Management Strategy**
- **Global State**: React Context API for app-wide state
- **Local State**: Component-level state for UI interactions
- **Persistent State**: AsyncStorage for settings, SQLite for data

## 🔍 Quality Assurance & Checkpoint System

### **Code Quality Verification Process**

Every development task and feature implementation must pass through the following automated quality checks before being marked as complete:

#### **Automated Quality Gates**
```typescript
// Quality Check Pipeline
interface QualityGate {
  name: string;
  required: boolean;
  threshold: number;
  command: string;
}

const qualityGates: QualityGate[] = [
  {
    name: "TypeScript Compilation",
    required: true,
    threshold: 100, // 0 errors allowed
    command: "npx tsc --noEmit"
  },
  {
    name: "ESLint Code Quality",
    required: true,
    threshold: 0, // 0 errors allowed (warnings acceptable)
    command: "npx eslint src/ --ext .ts,.tsx"
  },
  {
    name: "Prettier Code Formatting",
    required: true,
    threshold: 100, // All files must be formatted
    command: "npx prettier --check src/"
  },
  {
    name: "Unit Test Coverage",
    required: true,
    threshold: 80, // Minimum 80% coverage
    command: "npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false"
  },
  {
    name: "React Native Build Verification",
    required: true,
    threshold: 100, // Must build successfully
    command: "npx expo export --platform all"
  }
];
```

At the end of each development week, create a comprehensive checkpoint:

```bash
# Weekly Checkpoint Script
#!/bin/bash
WEEK_NUMBER=$(date +%U)
CHECKPOINT_TAG="week-${WEEK_NUMBER}-checkpoint"

# 1. Run full quality gate pipeline
npm run quality:check

# 2. Create tagged commit
git add .
git commit -m "Week ${WEEK_NUMBER} checkpoint - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git tag -a "${CHECKPOINT_TAG}" -m "Week ${WEEK_NUMBER} development checkpoint"

# 3. Generate checkpoint report
npm run checkpoint:report > "checkpoints/week-${WEEK_NUMBER}-report.md"

# 4. Backup database and assets
npm run backup:create "checkpoints/week-${WEEK_NUMBER}-backup"
```
